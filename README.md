Some of the C programs I wrote in practice. Most of them have performance better alternatives, but I still love em.

The execs are compiled on Ubuntu 22.04 and should work on x86_64 based linux systems. Use any compiler you please to compile for your platform.

Now, I doubt the implementations will be useful for you, but C for yourself.
